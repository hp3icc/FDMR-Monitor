**FDMR Monitor is a "web dashboard" for FreeDMR servers by OA4DOA.**

***This version has been forked from HBMonitor V2 by SP2ONG 2019-2022***

Some of the changes in FDMR Monitor:
- TG Count page added.
- Config file added.
- It's integrated with SQLite database.
- Improved usage of memory and CPU.
- Broadcasting groups has been added to save server's resources.
- JavaScript code was added to support broadcasting groups.
- The code has been updated to HTML5.
- Static and single TG's page added.
- Data QSO's now are showed in the dashboard.

FDMR Monitor has been tested on Debian v10 and v11

This version of FDMR Monitor requires a web server like apache2, lighttpd and 
php 7.x running on the server.

    cd /opt
    sudo git clone https://github.com/yuvelq/FDMR-Monitor
    cd FDMR-Monitor
    sudo chmod +x install.sh
    sudo ./install.sh
    sudo cp fdmr-mon_SAMPLE.cfg fdmr-mon.cfg
    - Edit fdmr-mon.cfg and adjust it to your server configuration:
      sudo nano fdmr-mon.cfg

    - Give readig permission to the config file:
      sudo chmod 644 fdmr-mon.cfg

    Copy the contents of the /opt/FDMR-Monitor/html directory to 
    the web server directory.
    - This example will work for Apache server:
      sudo cp /opt/FDMR-Monitor/html/* /var/www/html/ -r

    With this configuration you server will be available at:
      http://yourserverhost.org/

    Now you can configure the theme color and name for your Dashboard from the config.cfg file also
    you can define the height of the Server Activity 
    window: 45 1 row, 60 2 rows, 80 3 rows:
    HEIGHT_ACTIVITY = 45

    Now if you set TGCOUNT_INC to True the button will be added automatically
    If you want to modify or add any other button you will find a buttons.php file in the root of your
    web server.
    
    You can replace the logo with an image of your preference in the img/ directory img/logo.png
    
    - This will rotate the log file:
      sudo cp utils/logrotate/fdmr_mon /etc/logrotate.d/

    - Add the systemd file:
      sudo cp utils/systemd/fdmr_mon.service /lib/systemd/system/

    - Enable the monitor to start automatically after reboot:
      sudo systemctl enable fdmr_mon

    - You can start, stop, or restart with the next commands:
      sudo systemctl start fdmr_mon
      sudo systemctl stop fdmr_mon
      sudo systemctl restart fdmr_mon

    forward TCP port 9000 and web server port in firewall
        
    I recommend that you do not use the BRIDGE_INC = True option to display bridge information 
    (if you have multiple bridges displaying this information will increase the CPU load, 
    try to use BRIDGES_INC = False in config.py) 
    
    If for any reason you want to reset the database to the original values:
    sudo systemctl stop fdmr_mon
    sudo rm mon.db
    sudo python3 mon_db.py
    sudo systemctl start fdmr_mon
